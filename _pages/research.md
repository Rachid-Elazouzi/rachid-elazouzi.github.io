My research encompasses applied mathematics, networking, game theory, optimal control, and the economics of computing and communication networks. In recent work, I have focused on decentralized and distributed systems, addressing challenges in federated learning, blockchain technologies, automated market makers, datacenter scheduling, and resource allocation in wireless networks. Methodologically, my research integrates game theory, evolutionary games, optimisation, stochastic processes, queuing theory, and distributed algorithms, while remaining responsive to the demands of emerging applications and infrastructures


## Distributed and federated learning

Federated learning and optimization are closely intertwined because training a global model across distributed clients requires efficient, adaptive, and robust optimization strategies. In federated learning, each client updates a local model based on its own data, and these updates are aggregated to improve a shared global model. Optimization challenges in this context include heterogeneous data distributions, limited communication bandwidth, device variability, and the presence of malicious clients.
Researchers focus on developing advanced optimization algorithms to address these challenges. This includes techniques for client selection and sampling, which prioritize contributions from clients that improve convergence and reduce variance; gradient aggregation and compression, to minimize communication overhead; and robust optimization methods or game-theoretic approaches to mitigate the impact of unreliable or adversarial clients.
